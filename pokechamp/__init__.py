Pok√©Champ LLM Player Module

This module contains the LLM-based Pokemon battle player implementation,
including prompts, translation utilities, and various LLM backend integrations.

Environment loading
-------------------
Automatically load a local .env if present so API keys configured in
`pokechamp/.env` are available without exporting in the shell.
